>1. Let me be clear that the factors I used in this project are not the only features to be considered. A lot more factors would have been influencial up until this point and will play a certain role in the future. However, I reckoned these are the main features people would be most concerned of and hence, decided to exclude the factors besides the three parts I have used.

This project is about displaying the number of new cases and mortalities(also death rate) based on the number of vaccinations throughout this year. Also, I have come to know that some people doubt the effect of the vaccine. Hence, I thought it would be a good idea to see the effectiveness of the vaccine.

It seemed the number of vaccinations wasn't influencial to the death rate until I figured that the smoothed social distancing policy took place from October.

After some of pruning process, it now shows the vaccine is actually not meaningless in preventing the serious damage due to the infection.
