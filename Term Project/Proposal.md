> ### Proposal 
>
> - Computer Science and Engineering, Beomjoon Park(박범준), 18101216 / Visualization of Covid cases in Korea
> - This project is to present how many cases of Covid 19 have occured and changed throughout the year based on the number of people who have gotten vaccinated and to see whether smoking a cigarette increases the risk of dying when sustaining the covid-19. The purpose of this project is to acknowledge the correlation of several substances and the number of the cases(and also the death rate) in more of an intuitive way. 
> - 1. Get the data of the number of positive cases, vaccinations, death rate, the smoking rate and etc.
>   2. Convert them into csv files.
>   3. Determine the weights of the data(the number of vaccinations and the smoking rate) based off of how much influence each of them had on the number of cases and casualties.
